# magic-columns


With magic-columns you can define and name ranges within confluence tables. 
Then, you can build tables that refer to those rows or columns. 

For example, if four teams with four spaces report on kpi or other indicators in tables that are formatted the same, you could build a table in a separate location that agglomerate those results via a dynamic link to the four source tables. 

Linking tables across your confluence helps you facilitate the grouping, visualizing, and analysis of information spread out in tables across your confluence instance.
